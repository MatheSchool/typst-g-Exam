#show: book-page.with(title: "localization")

= Localization

== Languages

You can specify the language in which you want the text to appear. To do this, we use the "languaje"
property. It can take the values "en", "es", "de", "fr", "pt", "it", "nl".

```typst
#show: exam.with(
    language: "es",
)
```

== Customization

To customize an exam text, we can use the localization parameter.
For each parameter you can specify the indicated content, for example by indicating text in bold, italics or a different size.

```typst

  localization: (
    grade-table-queston: [Question],
    grade-table-total: [Total],
    grade-table-points: [Points],
    grade-table-grade: [Grade],
    point: [point],
    points: [points],
    page: [page],
    page-counter-display: [1 of 1],
    family-name: [Surname],
    given-name: [Name],
    group: [Group],
    date: [Date],
    draft-label: [Draft],
  ),

```
